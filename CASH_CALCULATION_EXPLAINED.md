# Cash Register Calculation Helper

## Your Numbers:
- Products sold value: **€38.20**
- Actual cash counted: **€23.35** 
- Withdrawal: **€20.00**
- Expected after withdrawal: **€3.35**
- Difference: **-€14.85**

## Let's Calculate:

### If you started with ZERO cash (€0):
1. Starting: €0.00
2. Sold products: +€38.20 → Register has €38.20
3. Withdrew: -€20.00 → Register should have **€18.20**
4. You counted: €23.35
5. Difference: €23.35 - €18.20 = **+€5.15** (you have MORE than expected!)

❌ This doesn't match your -€14.85

### If you started with €14.85:
1. Starting: €14.85
2. Sold products: +€38.20 → Register has €53.05
3. Withdrew: -€20.00 → Register should have **€33.05**
4. You counted: €23.35
5. Difference: €23.35 - €33.05 = **-€9.70**

❌ Still doesn't match

### If the €23.35 you recorded was BEFORE the withdrawal:
1. Starting: €X
2. Sold products: +€38.20
3. Register has: €23.35 (this is what you counted)
4. So starting was: €23.35 - €38.20 = **-€14.85** ❌ (impossible!)

### Alternative interpretation - you expected €3.35:
If you expected €3.35 in the register:
- Expected: €3.35
- Counted: €23.35
- Difference: €23.35 - €3.35 = **+€20.00** (exactly the withdrawal amount!)

**This suggests the withdrawal wasn't actually taken out yet!**

## Most Likely Scenario:

You recorded:
1. Counter reading with cash: €23.35 ← Money currently in register
2. Withdrawal: €20.00 ← You plan to take this out (but haven't yet?)

Expected calculation:
- Started with: €0.00
- Sales: +€38.20
- SHOULD have: €38.20
- Withdrawal recorded: -€20.00
- SHOULD remain: €18.20
- But you have: €23.35
- Extra: +€5.15

OR the withdrawal wasn't deducted from the physical cash yet?

## To get your -€14.85 difference:

Working backwards from your numbers:
- Expected in register: €3.35
- Actual in register: €23.35 (WAIT - this is wrong!)
- Actual should be: €3.35 - €14.85 = **-€11.50** ❌ (impossible!)

OR:
- Actual: €23.35
- Expected: €23.35 + €14.85 = **€38.20**
- Which means: Expected = Sales revenue exactly!
- So starting cash = €0, withdrawal not applied yet

## I think the issue is:

The system shows:
- **Expected**: €23.35
- **Actual**: €23.35  
- **Difference**: €0.00

But it SHOULD show:
- **Expected**: €38.20 (sales) - €20.00 (withdrawal) = **€18.20**
- **Actual**: €23.35
- **Difference**: €23.35 - €18.20 = **+€5.15**

OR if withdrawal wasn't taken yet:
- **Expected**: €38.20 (sales)
- **Actual**: €23.35
- **Difference**: €23.35 - €38.20 = **-€14.85** ✅ THIS MATCHES!

**So the withdrawal shouldn't be counted because it wasn't physically removed yet!**

## Solution:

Delete the €20 withdrawal record (it was recorded but not physically taken), then:
- **Expected**: €38.20 (from sales)
- **Actual**: €23.35 (what you counted)
- **Difference**: -€14.85 ✅ CORRECT!

This means €14.85 is missing/unaccounted for.
