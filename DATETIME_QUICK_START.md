# Quick Start: Custom Date/Time for Readings

## What Changed?

Added a **date/time picker** to the Counter Reading form. You can now choose when a reading was taken!

## Where Is It?

**Counter Reading tab** â†’ Just above "Cash in Register" field

**Field name**: ðŸ“… Reading Date & Time

## How to Use

### Normal Use (Most Common)
1. Open Counter Reading tab
2. Field automatically shows **current date and time**
3. Enter your counter values
4. Submit â†’ Done! âœ…

**No extra steps needed for regular daily readings!**

### Backdate a Reading (Forgot Yesterday)
1. Open Counter Reading tab  
2. **Click the date/time field**
3. **Change it** to yesterday's date/time
4. Enter the counter values you forgot to record
5. Submit â†’ Reading saved with yesterday's timestamp! âœ…

### Multiple Readings Same Day
1. **Morning**: Set time to 08:00, submit
2. **Afternoon**: Already reset to current time (~14:00), submit
3. **Evening**: Set time to 22:00, submit

Result: Three separate readings showing sales throughout the day! ðŸ“Š
