The application will start on `http://0.0.0.0:5000`

### Step 4: Run as a Background Service (Optional but Recommended)

Create a systemd service file for automatic startup:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/coffee-calculator.service
```

Add the following content (replace `/home/yourusername` with your actual path):

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Coffee Cost Calculator
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=yourusername
WorkingDirectory=/home/yourusername/coffee-calculator
Environment="PATH=/home/yourusername/coffee-calculator/venv/bin"
ExecStart=/home/yourusername/coffee-calculator/venv/bin/python app.py

## Troubleshooting

### Service won't start after installation
```bash
# Check service status and logs
sudo systemctl status coffee-calculator
sudo journalctl -u coffee-calculator -n 50

# Common fixes:
# 1. Ensure port 5000 is not in use
sudo lsof -i :5000

# 2. Check file permissions
ls -la /path/to/coffee-calculator

# 3. Verify Python environment
source /path/to/coffee-calculator/venv/bin/activate
python --version
pip list

# 4. Restart the service
sudo systemctl restart coffee-calculator
```

### Port 5000 already in use
If port 5000 is occupied, edit the systemd service file:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/coffee-calculator.service
```
Change the port in the ExecStart line:
```
ExecStart=/path/to/venv/bin/gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:5001 ...
```
Then reload and restart:
```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart coffee-calculator
```

### Database errors
```bash
# Check if database exists and has correct permissions
ls -la /path/to/coffee-calculator/data/

# If needed, recreate the database
rm /path/to/coffee-calculator/data/coffee_calculator.db
sudo systemctl restart coffee-calculator
```

### PDF generation fails
- Ensure reportlab is installed: `pip install reportlab`
- Check system dependencies: `sudo apt install python3-dev libfreetype6-dev`
- Restart the service after installing dependencies

### Cloudflare tunnel not working
- Verify cloudflared is running: `sudo systemctl status cloudflared`
- Check tunnel status: `cloudflared tunnel info coffee-calculator`
- Review logs: `journalctl -u cloudflared -f`
- Ensure tunnel points to correct port (5000 or your custom port)

### Configuration won't save
- Check database file permissions: `ls -la data/coffee_calculator.db`
- Verify data directory is writable: `ls -ld data/`
- Check service logs: `sudo journalctl -u coffee-calculator -f`

## Security Notes

- ‚úÖ Application runs as systemd service with proper user isolation
- ‚úÖ Gunicorn provides production-grade WSGI server
- ‚úÖ Cloudflare Access handles authentication (as per your setup)
- ‚úÖ SQLite database stored in protected data directory
- ‚ö†Ô∏è For production, consider:
  - Using a reverse proxy like Nginx for SSL/TLS
  - Setting up regular database backups
  - Monitoring logs for unusual activity
  - Keeping system and dependencies updated

## Uninstalling

To completely remove the application:

```bash
cd coffee-calculator
sudo ./install.sh
# Select option 2 (Complete removal)
```

The uninstall process will:
1. Stop and remove the systemd service
2. Remove the Python virtual environment
3. **Ask if you want to delete the database** (your configurations)
4. **Ask if you want to delete all application files**

This gives you full control over what gets removed.

## Database Backup

The update process automatically creates database backups. To manually backup:

```bash
# Backup database
sudo cp /path/to/coffee-calculator/data/coffee_calculator.db ~/coffee_calculator_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).db

# Restore database
sudo cp ~/coffee_calculator_backup_YYYYMMDD.db /path/to/coffee-calculator/data/coffee_calculator.db
sudo chown your-user:your-user /path/to/coffee-calculator/data/coffee_calculator.db
sudo systemctl restart coffee-calculator
```

**Note:** Updates automatically create timestamped backups in the `data/` directory.
