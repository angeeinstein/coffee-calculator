# Sales Tracking Shared with Configurations - Update Summary

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Database Schema Updates

**Added `config_id` to all sales tracking tables:**
- `counter_readings.config_id` - Links reading to a specific configuration
- `cash_register_events.config_id` - Links cash events to a configuration  
- `sales_records.config_id` - Links sales to a configuration

**Foreign Key Behavior:**
- `FOREIGN KEY (config_id) REFERENCES configurations(id) ON DELETE SET NULL`
- If a configuration is deleted, sales data is preserved but unlinked
- Allows historical data retention even after config deletion

**Migration Support:**
- Automatic column addition for existing databases
- Checks for column existence before adding
- Backward compatible - existing data continues to work

### 2. API Endpoint Enhancements

**All sales endpoints now support `config_id` parameter:**

**Counter Readings:**
- `GET /api/counter-readings?config_id=X` - Filter by configuration
- `POST /api/counter-readings` - Accepts `config_id` in request body
- `DELETE /api/counter-readings/<id>` - NEW! Delete readings with permission check

**Cash Register:**
- `GET /api/cash-register/balance?config_id=X` - Calculate for specific config
- `GET /api/cash-register/events?config_id=X` - Filter events by config
- `POST /api/cash-register/events` - Accepts `config_id` in request body

**Statistics:**
- `GET /api/sales-statistics?days=30&config_id=X` - Config-specific analytics

**Access Control:**
- Users can access sales for configurations they own
- Users can access sales for configurations shared with them
- Delete requires edit permission on shared configs

### 3. JavaScript Updates

**currentConfigId Integration:**
- All sales tracking functions now use `currentConfigId`
- Sales data automatically filters by current loaded configuration
- When switching configs, sales data switches too

**Auto-Refresh Counter Inputs:**
- `populateCounterInputs()` called after:
  - Adding a new drink
  - Removing a drink
  - Calculating costs
- Fixes the tab refresh issue - counter inputs update immediately

**Delete Functionality:**
- Added delete button to each reading in history
- Confirmation dialog before deletion
- Cascading delete for associated sales records
- Auto-refresh after deletion

**Improved User Feedback:**
- "0 products calculated" fixed with better messaging
- First reading: "First reading recorded (no previous reading to compare)"
- Subsequent readings: "X products calculated"
- Clear error messages for permission issues

### 4. Shared Configuration Behavior

**When User A shares a config with User B:**

✅ **User B can see:**
- All counter readings for that configuration
- All cash register events for that configuration
- All sales statistics for that configuration
- Cash register balance and reconciliation

✅ **User B can add (if has edit permission):**
- New counter readings
- New cash register events
- Sales are automatically calculated

✅ **User B can delete (if has edit permission):**
- Counter readings they or User A created
- Must confirm deletion (affects sales records)

❌ **User B cannot see:**
- User A's other configurations (unless also shared)
- Sales data from User A's other machines/configs

### 5. Use Cases

**Scenario 1: Partners sharing a coffee shop**
- Both users load the "Main Shop" configuration
- Both can record daily counter readings
- Both can record cash withdrawals (buying supplies)
- Both see the same cash register reconciliation
- Both see combined sales statistics

**Scenario 2: Shift workers on same machine**
- Morning shift loads "Espresso Machine 1" config
- Records opening counter reading
- Records any cash events during shift
- Evening shift loads same config
- Records closing reading
- Sales automatically calculated between shifts
- Both see complete sales history

**Scenario 3: Multiple locations**
- User creates "Location A" and "Location B" configs
- Shares "Location A" with manager at that location
- Each location has independent sales tracking
- Owner can switch between configs to see each location's data

### 6. Data Isolation

**Per-Configuration:**
- Counter readings filtered by config_id
- Cash events filtered by config_id
- Sales records filtered by config_id
- Statistics calculated per config

**Backward Compatibility:**
- Sales data without config_id still works (user-level tracking)
- Gradually migrates as users load configurations
- No data loss during migration

### 7. Bug Fixes

**Issue 1: Counter Reading Tab Not Refreshing**
- **Problem:** Adding/removing drinks didn't update counter inputs until tab switch
- **Solution:** Call `populateCounterInputs()` after drink changes and calculations
- **Status:** ✅ Fixed

**Issue 2: "0 products calculated"**
- **Problem:** First reading shows confusing "0 products calculated" message
- **Solution:** Better messaging distinguishing first vs subsequent readings
- **Status:** ✅ Fixed

**Issue 3: No Delete Functionality**
- **Problem:** Couldn't remove erroneous readings
- **Solution:** Added DELETE endpoint with permission checks and confirmation
- **Status:** ✅ Fixed

**Issue 4: Sales Not Linked to Configurations**
- **Problem:** Sales tracking was per-user, not per-config
- **Solution:** Added config_id to all sales tables and endpoints
- **Status:** ✅ Fixed

### 8. Database Migration Example

**Before Update:**
```sql
counter_readings: user_id, reading_date, counter_data, cash_in_register, notes
cash_register_events: user_id, event_date, event_type, amount, description
sales_records: user_id, start_reading_id, end_reading_id, product_name, ...
```

**After Update:**
```sql
counter_readings: user_id, config_id, reading_date, counter_data, cash_in_register, notes
cash_register_events: user_id, config_id, event_date, event_type, amount, description
sales_records: user_id, config_id, start_reading_id, end_reading_id, product_name, ...
```

**Migration happens automatically on app startup via init_db()**

### 9. Security & Permissions

**Read Access:**
- Owner can always read their sales data
- Shared users can read if config is shared (any permission level)

**Write Access:**
- Owner can always write to their sales data
- Shared users can write if `can_edit = 1`

**Delete Access:**
- Owner can delete any readings for their configs
- Shared users can delete if `can_edit = 1`
- Deletion requires confirmation
- Cascades to sales_records automatically

### 10. Testing Checklist

- [x] Database migration adds config_id columns
- [x] Existing sales data continues to work
- [x] Counter readings filter by config_id
- [x] Cash events filter by config_id
- [x] Statistics calculate per config
- [x] Shared users see same sales data
- [x] Permission checks work correctly
- [x] Delete functionality works
- [x] Counter inputs refresh automatically
- [x] First reading message improved
- [x] Config switching updates sales view

### 11. Deployment Instructions

**Update your server:**

```bash
cd /path/to/coffee-calculator
git pull
sudo ./install.sh
# Select option 2 (Update)
```

**What happens:**
1. Code updates pulled
2. Service restarts
3. Database migration runs automatically
4. New config_id columns added
5. All existing features continue working
6. New functionality immediately available

**No manual database changes needed!**

### 12. User Documentation Updates

Updated these files:
- `SALES_TRACKING_GUIDE.md` - Add section on shared configurations
- `SALES_TRACKING_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Updated architecture notes
- `README.md` - Updated sales tracking section

**Key documentation points:**
- Sales now travel with configurations when shared
- Both users see the same sales data
- Edit permission required for adding/deleting
- Each configuration has independent sales tracking

## Summary

Sales tracking is now fully integrated with configuration sharing. When you share a configuration, you're also sharing:
- Counter readings history
- Cash register events
- Sales statistics
- Cash reconciliation data

This makes it perfect for:
- Partners managing the same business
- Shift workers on the same machine
- Multiple users collaborating on the same location

While still maintaining separation between different configurations/locations.

All bugs reported have been fixed:
✅ Counter reading tab refreshes immediately
✅ Better messaging for first readings
✅ Delete functionality added with proper permissions
✅ Sales linked to configurations for sharing
